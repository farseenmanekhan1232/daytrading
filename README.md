This repository contains a comprehensive, structured routine for day trading Indian index options, refactored to integrate the core psychological principles of professional trading as taught by Tom Hougaard. It merges a time-segmented technical framework with the critical mindset needed to overcome common behavioral errors.

The routine emphasizes that **consistent success is not a technical problem, but a human one.** It is designed to cultivate discipline, emotional resilience, and a statistical edge, starting from August 11, 2025.

## Core Philosophy: Mindset Over Method
This routine is built on the understanding that 90% of traders fail not because of faulty indicators, but because of faulty thinking. Before any technical analysis, internalize these foundational truths:

-   **Trading is an Internal Challenge**: The market is not your enemy; it is a mirror reflecting your habits, fears, and discipline. Your primary battle is against your own emotional triggers and cognitive biases.
-   **Practice Makes Permanent, Not Perfect**: Only *correct* practice, combined with honest self-review, leads to improvement. Following a routine without introspection reinforces bad habits.
-   **Embrace Discomfort**: Success lies in doing what is emotionally difficult: cutting losses quickly (accepting pain), holding winners (fighting the fear of giving back profits), and adding to winning positions.
-   **Profit, Not "Being Right," is the Goal**: The purpose of trading is to make money, not to prove a prediction correct. This requires accepting that you can have a low win rate (e.g., 30-40%) and still be highly profitable through superior risk management.
-   **Think in Probabilities, Not Predictions**: Abandon the "supermarket mentality" of buying something because it looks cheap. Instead, use data and scenario analysis to build a statistical roadmap.

> *"If 90% of traders are losing, what does the 10% do differently? Think and act differently."* - Tom Hougaard

## Key Principles of Execution
-   **Data-Driven Scenario Planning**: Before the market opens, ask structured, statistical questions. *Example: "If Monday opens with a >50 point gap, what is the probability it will be filled by EOD?"* This replaces emotional guessing with a statistical edge.
-   **The Asymmetry of Fear and Hope**: Your mindset must be the opposite of the average trader. **Feel fear only in losing trades** (leading to quick cuts) and **feel hope only in winning trades** (leading to letting them run).
-   **Opening Range Breakout (ORB) as a Statistical Tool**: Use the 15-30 min ORB not as a magic signal, but as a framework. The day's high/low is often set early. A breakout confirmed by volume (≥1.25× avg) and option chain data provides a probabilistic entry, not a certainty.
-   **Option Chain for Structure, Not Prophecy**: Use OI, PCR, and Max Pain to identify key support/resistance levels where liquidity rests. These are zones of potential conflict, not guaranteed turning points. A PCR >1.3 or <0.7 is a signal for potential contrarian thinking, not a blind trigger.
-   **Risk Management is Emotional Management**: A stop-loss is not just a price; it is a pre-commitment to being wrong. Honoring it without hesitation is a measure of discipline. Position size should be reduced in high-volatility/low-conviction environments and is a tool to manage emotional capital, not just financial capital.

## Daily Routine: The Fusion of Process and Psychology
Follow this sequence each trading day. Each technical action is paired with a psychological checkpoint. All times in IST.

### 1. Pre-Market Preparation (7:00 AM - 9:15 AM)
-   **Technical Actions**:
    -   Review global cues (US close, Asian opens) and Gift Nifty to form an initial bias.
    -   Check the economic calendar for market-moving events.
    -   Conduct an initial scan of the Option Chain: Spot, ATM, OI concentrations, PCR, and Max Pain.
-   **Psychological Checkpoint & Mindset Focus**:
    -   **Scenario Planning**: Develop 2-3 data-driven scenarios for the day (e.g., "Scenario A: Gap up and trend," "Scenario B: Gap fill and range"). This is not a prediction; it's preparation.
    -   **Mental Rehearsal**: Visualize executing your plan flawlessly. Visualize taking a small loss without emotion. Visualize holding a winner through a minor pullback. This prepares you for the discomfort ahead.
    -   **Set Daily Intentions**: Write down one behavioral goal, e.g., "I will not move my stop-loss," or "I will wait for my setup and not chase."

### 2. Opening Session (9:15 AM - 10:15 AM)
-   **Technical Actions**:
    -   Mark the 15-min Opening Range (OR). Observe initial OI and volume spikes.
    -   Execute ORB strategy only if confirmed by significant volume (≥1.25× avg).
    -   Monitor PCR shifts for early signs of sentiment change.
-   **Psychological Checkpoint & Mindset Focus**:
    -   **Execute Without Hesitation**: Your plan was made in a calm state. Trust it. Do not let opening volatility paralyze you.
    -   **Non-Negotiable Stops**: Place your stop-loss immediately. This is your primary defense against emotional decision-making. A loss is only a data point.
    -   **Avoid FOMO**: If you miss the initial move, do not chase. The market will offer other opportunities. Chasing is a fear-based action.

### 3. Mid-Morning Monitoring (10:15 AM - 12:00 PM)
-   **Technical Actions**:
    -   Identify if the market is trending or consolidating. Use OI levels as S/R guides.
    -   Re-analyze the option chain around 11:00 AM for structural changes.
    -   Enter trend-following trades based on your pre-defined rules.
-   **Psychological Checkpoint & Mindset Focus**:
    -   **Let Winners Run**: This is where discipline is tested. If you are in a profitable trade, resist the urge to take small profits out of fear. Trail your stop-loss and allow the trade to work.
    -   **Patience**: If the market is consolidating, do not force trades out of boredom. Doing nothing is a profitable position.

### 4. Lunch Hour Check (12:00 PM - 1:00 PM)
-   **Technical Actions**:
    -   Note the typically low volume and volatility. Identify the trading range.
    -   Scan for IV contraction, which may favor range-bound strategies (e.g., Iron Condor).
    -   Monitor the European open for initial reactions.
-   **Psychological Checkpoint & Mindset Focus**:
    -   **Discipline in Stillness**: The primary risk here is overtrading due to boredom. Step away if necessary. Protect your mental capital for the more volatile afternoon session.

### 5. Afternoon Session (1:00 PM - 2:30 PM)
-   **Technical Actions**:
    -   Look for momentum continuation or reversal as European markets get into full swing.
    -   Re-scan the option chain at 1:30 PM. Note any significant shifts in OI or Max Pain.
    -   Enter swing trades based on established trends or key level breaks.
-   **Psychological Checkpoint & Mindset Focus**:
    -   **Stay Objective**: Do not let the morning's P&L affect your afternoon decisions. Each trade is independent. Avoid "protecting" small profits by refusing to take valid setups.

### 6. Closing Hour Execution (2:30 PM - 3:30 PM)
-   **Technical Actions**:
    -   Monitor for high volume as positions are squared off.
    -   On expiry days, watch for high gamma and theta decay; Max Pain becomes highly relevant.
    -   Scale out of winning positions or trail stops tightly.
-   **Psychological Checkpoint & Mindset Focus**:
    -   **Avoid Revenge Trading**: If you are down on the day, do not increase size or take low-probability trades to "get back to even." This is ego-driven and leads to larger losses. Accept the day's result and stick to your plan.
    -   **Finish Strong**: End the day with disciplined execution, regardless of the outcome. How you finish sets the mental tone for the next day.

### 7. Post-Market Review (3:30 PM - 4:30 PM + Evening)
-   **Technical Actions**:
    -   Log all trades with entry, exit, P&L, and the technical reason for the trade.
-   **Psychological Checkpoint & Mindset Focus**:
    -   **The Crucial Self-Audit**: This is the most important part of your day. In your journal, answer these questions:
        -   *Did I follow my plan? If not, why?*
        -   *What emotions did I feel at entry, during the trade, and at exit? (Fear, greed, hope, anxiety?)*
        -   *Where was I disciplined? Where did my discipline fail?*
    -   **Accountability**: Take full ownership of your results. Do not blame the market, news, or your tools. Your P&L is a direct result of your mindset and actions.

## Weekly/Monthly Overlays
-   **Monday**: Focus on gap statistics. Was the weekend bias validated?
-   **Tuesday (Nifty Expiry)**: High gamma. Focus on executing your plan amid volatility, not predicting it.
-   **Wednesday**: Often consolidates. A good day to practice patience.
-   **Thursday (Sensex Expiry)**: Volatility. Another test of emotional control.
-   **Friday**: Defensive. Focus on protecting weekly gains. The week-end review is critical: analyze your journal for recurring behavioral patterns.
-   **Monthly Expiry Week**: Track IV term structure; deploy butterflies in final days.
-   **Quarterly**: Audit metrics; adjust for rebalancing.
